Portrait of Molly M. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/hvnEKC). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2.

The new split view in iOS 9 on the iPad is fantastic. Swiping over the Photos app with my reference material instead of importing and wasting valuable canvas space is a treat.

Time lapse video recorded within Procreate, completed in approximately 6 hours.
