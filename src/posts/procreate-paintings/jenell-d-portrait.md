Portrait of Jenell D. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/7i99Kc). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2. 

Things got a little dark in the face, but I guess that's what inexperience with digital charcoals gets you. Yup, still haven't a clue what I'm doing with this app yet...
