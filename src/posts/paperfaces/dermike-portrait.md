Decided to put some time in with 53's new Pencil stylus and experiment with the [Blend feature](/mastering-paper/pencil-first-look/) some more. I may have pushed the blurs too far since I think it killed a lot of the layered watercolor textures I started withâ€¦

Mental note: a little Blend goes a long way.
