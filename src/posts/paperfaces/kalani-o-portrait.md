PaperFaces portrait of Kalani O. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/IfaqVH).

I often find I work fairly quick when dealing in grayscale, especially when the contrast is dialed up high. To really sell the realism in this one I spent a good deal of time drawing individual strands of hair with the pencil tool.

Started with dark grays and gradually increased the brightness until I was selectively adding wisps of pure white. A few coats of gray watercolor to smoothen out any abrupt transitions of color, and I called it a day.
