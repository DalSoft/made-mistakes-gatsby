PaperFaces portrait of Lisset M. inspired by a photograph on Sktchy.

For this drawing I wanted to try something a little looser than my latest drawings. Of course I couldn't leave well enough alone and refined contours and shapes after "it was finished."

The original drawing is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/162842) if you want a closer look or to riff on.
