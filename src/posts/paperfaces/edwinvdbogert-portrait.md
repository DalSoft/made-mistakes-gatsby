PaperFaces portrait of [@edwinvdbogert](https://twitter.com/edwinvdbogert). A replacement [Pogo Connect Smart Pen](/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/) arrived just in time for me to complete this drawing with a degree of realism I wouldn't have been able to without it. Thank's *Ten One Design* for taking care of my defective Pogo Connect so fast!
