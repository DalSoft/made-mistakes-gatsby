PaperFaces portrait of Brooke T. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/S3B8m).

My [first drawing](https://paper.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/5492331) completed with version 3.0 of Paper by FiftyThree. So far really enjoying the full screen zoom just wish it had more levels of magnification.
