Something a little different from the normal no face, square format composition. PaperFaces portrait commission for <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbydharrell">@bobbydharrell</a> of his daughter Aurora.

First drawing I've completed since receiving yet another replacement Pogo Connect. Not sure if it's the updated firmware or the extra solder inside, but I have to press extra hard to get a full range of value. Perhaps I should take a look at the Pogo iOS app to see if I can adjust the tip's sensitivityâ€¦
