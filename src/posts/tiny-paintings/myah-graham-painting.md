Tiny portrait of Myah Graham inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](https://sktchy.com/gAj7DH). Painted with watercolor on hot press paper. 

Final painting measures 2.5\" x 1.5\". Facial features at this size sure are difficult to pull off accurately. I constantly found myself getting the proportions wrong and painting them too large.
